			  <p><b>The Holy Land.</b> Avoiding the political divides of the present, represents a combined area
				inclusive of the states of Israel, Palestine, and significant portions of the Kingdom of Jordan, as
				well as parts of southern Lebanon and Syria.</p>
				<p>Given the geographical placement of the Holy Land, and it serving as a land bridge connecting
				Asia, Europe and Africa together, one can only begin to imagine the history witnessed in the
				Holy Land. From the dawn of man, to the rise and fall of the most prolific empires in history, on
				to the lifetime of Christ, and through to the millennials to follow, the Holy Land stands as a
				testament to time.</p>
				<p>The significance of the Holy Land isn’t known for its geographical location, rather it is known for
				its importance to all the three Abrahamic religions. For Jews, it is the promised Land of the
				prophet Moses, and the subsequent rich history forged over time, and evidently clear in the
				Torah and Old Testament alike. For Muslims, the Holy Land is the host to the third holiest site
				is all of Islam; the Dome of the Rock, from which the prophet Mohammad rose to Heaven, the
				event known as the Isra and Mi’raj.</p>
				<p>Yet, for Christians, the Hold Land is synonymous with the biblical land of Israel. The land where
				Christ was born and raised, the land on which Christ travelled, preached, cured, preformed
				miracles and most importantly brought us into the Light of the Father. The Holy Land
				represents the origins Christianity, and the starting point of the Church.</p>
				<p>The Holy Land today is the destination, where you, a pilgrim, can walk in the footsteps of Christ
				and learn of the origins of the Church. The Holy Land is the destination to learn of the past, and
				to experience the cultures of ancient and modern times.</p>
